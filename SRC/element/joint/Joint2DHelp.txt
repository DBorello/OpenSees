Joint2D is a two dimensional element, with four nodes. It generates an internal node with
an extra degree of freedom, and connects the external nodes to this internal node via
multi-point constraints. The tag for the internal node must be a new tag that does notbelong to any existing node. The multi-point constraints are developed specifically forjoint element and the allow the element to simulate the shear panel kinematics. Joint2D must be
used along with 'Penalty', or 'Transformation' constraint handler to allow the multi point
constraints work perfectly. It is possible to introduce optionalrotational springs at the
external nodes to allow extra flexibility, by inputting uniaxialmaterials Mat1, Mat2, Mat3
and Mat4. A uniaxial material model is used as the rotationalspring relating shear
deformation to shear equivalent moment. The nodes should be entered in a clockwise or
counter-clockwise order. The nodes should be located in such a way a parallelogram can be
constructed on them.

To maintain the shear panel kinematics, four multi-point constraints are automatically
added to the domain. These constraints might be set to cover the second order deformations,
using the LrgDisp flag. If the LrgDisp flag is set to zero, it indicates that the element
will use a constant constraint matrix, calculated based on the initial configuration. In
this case the element will not undergo the exact deformation for large deformations. For larger deformations we may use a non-zero value for LrgDisp. A non-zero flag indicates
that the MP constraint matrix will be time varying and the constraint matrix is updated
for every time step. Value 1 indicates time varying constraint without length correction.
If value 2 is chosen, the time varying constraint will be activated along with a length
correction procedure to maintain the initial length of the multi-point constraints.

The valid queries to a Joint2D element when creating an element recorder are 'internalNode',
'deformation', 'force', 'deformationANDforce', 'size', 'stiff'.

Example: element Joint2D 2 1 2 3 4 5 1 0

Constructs a Joint2D element with tag 2 that is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4. The
element will generate a center node with tag 5, and it uses the uniaxial material object
with tag 1 as the shear panel spring. The joint element introduced here will be a joint,
without rotational springs at external nodes. The generated multipoint constraint
matrices will be constant and they do not include large deformations.


Example: element Joint2D 2 1 2 3 4 5 2 2 2 2 1 2

Constructs a Joint2D element with tag 2 that is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4. The
element will generate a center node with tag 5, and it uses the uniaxial material object
with tag 2 for four rotational springs at external nodes and a material with tag 1 as the
shear panel spring. The generated multipoint constraint matrices will be time vaying to
cover large deformations and if corrects the nodas positions to maintain the initial joint
size.
